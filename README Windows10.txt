Before running the script you must make sure that programming language Python is installed on your computer, if its not download it from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After this, you must find the folder you downloaded from me, this will most likely be in your downloads folder or wherever you saved it, this will be called "SlotmachineGame" and is the folder this file is in.

When you have found the folder, left click it once then while holding down shift, then select the option "Copy as path".

Next go into your search menu and type in command prompt, choose the first option.

When in the command promp window type "cd ".

Then right click in the command prompt and some text should appear.
