THIS GUIDE IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY!

Before running the script you must make sure that programming language Python is installed on your computer, if its not download it from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After this, you must find the folder you downloaded from me, this will mostlikely be in your downloads folder or wherever you saved it, this will be called "SlotmachineGame" and is the folder this file is in.

When you have found the folder, right click it with your mouse or trackpad then and select the option "Open in Terminal".

Next, copy this piece of text "python slotmachine.py".

Head into the Terminal or Command Prompt window (They are the same thing).

When you are in Terminal or Command Prompt, right click, you should see the text you just copied appear on the screen. 

Press the enter key.

The game should begin.
