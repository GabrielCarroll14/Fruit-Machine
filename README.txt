MAC OS:

Before running the script you must make sure that programming language Python is installed on your computer, if its not download it from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After this, you must find the folder you downloaded from me, this will most likely be in your downloads folder or wherever you saved it, this will be called "SlotmachineGame" and is the folder this file is in.

When you have found the folder, right click it with your mouse or trackpad then and select the option "New Terminal at Folder".

Next, copy this piece of text "slotmachine.py", paste it into the Terminal then press enter.

The game should begin.
